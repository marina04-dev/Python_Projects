# Magic Squares 
""" A magic square is a 2D matrix composed of n^2 integers
where n is the length of one row/column. In a magic square
each row, each column and the 2 diagonals must sum to the 
same value. """

""" This Function given a 2D matrix the function determimes 
if the square is magic or not and displays "magic" or "not magic" 
accordingly """

""" The program takes an input n, representing the length of one 
row of the matrix. It will then take n lines of input containing
n integers seperated by spaces. """
