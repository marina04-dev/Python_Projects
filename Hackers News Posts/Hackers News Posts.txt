Exploring Hackers News Posts
In this project, we'll compare two different types
of posts from Hacker News, a popular site where technology
related stories (or 'posts') are voted and commented upon.
The two types of posts we'll explore begin with either
Ask HN or Show HN.

Users submit Ask HN posts to ask the Hacker News
community a specific question, such as "What is the best
online course you've ever taken?" Likewise, users submit
Show HN posts to show the Hacker News community a project,
product, or just generally something interesting.

We'll specifically compare these two types of posts to
determine the following:

Do Ask HN or Show HN receive more comments on average?
Do posts created at a certain time receive more comments on average?
It should be noted that the data set we're working with
was reduced from almost 300,000 rows to approximately
20,000 rows by removing all submissions that did not receive
any comments, and then randomly sampling from the remaining
submissions.



Conclusion
In this project, we analyzed ask posts and show posts
to determine which type of post and time receive the most
comments on average. Based on our analysis, to maximize the
amount of comments a post receives, we'd recommend the post
be categorized as ask post and created between 15:00 and 16:00
(3:00 pm est - 4:00 pm est).

However, it should be noted that the data set we
analyzed excluded posts without any comments. Given that,
it's more accurate to say that of the posts that received
comments, ask posts received more comments on average and
ask posts created between 15:00 and 16:00
(3:00 pm est - 4:00 pm est) received the most comments
on average.
